# FreeSurfer project - brain morphology

## About the project

**Full title:** Brain morphology in central disorders of hypersomnolence: First analysis from the global multi-site neuroimaging consortium NICHY

**Analysis leads:** Eva van Heese, Niels de Joode, and Keetje Voogd

**Contact details:** e.vanheese@amsterdamumc.nl

This project represents the **first analysis of the NICHY consortium**. This first study focuses on **brain morphology** of the **cortex and subcortex** using **T1-weighted MRI** data. Specifically, we aim to:  

- Improve understanding of **brain morphometry** differences between narcolepsy type 1, type 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, and controls.  
- Examine relationships between brain morphometry alterations and **clinical characteristics**, such as disease severity, diagnostic outcomes (MSLT, PSG), onset, duration, and medication use.  

The preregistration of this analysis is available at [the open science framework](https://osf.io/8fdqc).

## Before you start

### Leaderboard

To help monitor each site's progress, we maintain a **leaderboard** that outlines all the steps detailed in these guidelines. If you are responsible for data processing at your site, please:

1. **Request access** to the NICHY Leaderboard.  
2. **Regularly update your progress** as you complete each step of the analysis pipeline.

You can view the leaderboard here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [NICHY Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4-qiyZM0aJkHxsnCzTBjaEYqRw58aoUS0GbYrUE9fw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

> **Note:** With the above link, you can **view** the leaderboard but cannot make edits.  
> To update your siteâ€™s progress, please **request editor rights** from the coordinating team.

### Analysis workflow and documentation

The workflow used for this project has been developed and thoroughly tested by the [**ENIGMA consortium**](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/), which has a very similar structure to NICHY. On this page, we will link to ENIGMA resources for step-by-step guidance, and provide additional NICHY-specific information.

The tools selected for the analysis were chosen for two main reasons:

1. **Consistency across sites:**  
   To make sure that the analysis is performed in the **exact same way** at each participating site.  
   This harmonized approach is essential to reduce **site effects** in large-scale neuroimaging studies.

2. **Ease of use:**  
   The tools are designed to be as **user-friendly** as possible, even for researchers or students with limited experience in MRI processing.  
   They require **no programming background**, only access to a **server** and the **MRI data**. Some **basic skills** in working with files, command-line tools, or general computer usage can help speed up the setup and processing.

While there may be an **initial learning curve**, once you complete the setup you will find the tools highly efficient and reliable for running analyses at your site.

### Visual overview of the workflow

*(Image to be added)*

The figure below shows how the steps for data organisation and processing. Most of these steps will be performed using the **Nipoppy framework**, which automates and streamlines the workflow.  

Each step is **numbered** and corresponds to the sections described below. The links in each section will take you to the **ENIGMA-infra** documentation, which provides more detailed instructions.
