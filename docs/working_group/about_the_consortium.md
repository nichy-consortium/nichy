# About the NICHY consortium


The NeuroImaging Consortium in Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence (NICHY) is an established international research consortium dedicated to understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH) through **large-scale, collaborative neuroimaging studies**. NICHY integrates structural and functional MRI data across multiple sites worldwide to identify robust imaging markers associated with CDH, including narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2), and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), as well as healthy controls.  

## Aims
The overarching aim of NICHY is to improve understanding of how CDH affects brain structure and function and to facilitate the development of data-driven approaches for differential diagnosis, clinical stratification, and eventually targeted treatment. By pooling multi-site MRI data and using harmonized processing pipelines, NICHY enables well-powered analyses that account for site-specific and cross-cultural variability.

Key research questions addressed by NICHY include:
- How do brain structure and function differ between individuals with CDH and healthy, well-rested controls?
- How do structural and functional brain profiles vary across NT1, NT2, and IH?
- Can MRI-derived measures serve as future diagnostic tools to differentiate between CDH subtypes or newly proposed phenotypes?


## Joining the consortium
All participating sites are welcome to contribute data to NICHY projects if their data meet the following requirements: 
- Diagnosis of NT1, NT2, **or** IH according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), **or** healthy control status
- Available structural and/or functional MRI data 
- There is **no minimum** number of participants required per site or scanner.

Participating sites retain **full ownership** of their data. Responsibility for obtaining ethical approval, informed consent, and data protection compliance, rests with each participating site. 

NICHY provides an open framework for collaboration, allowing sites to propose new studies while ensuring data privacy and adherence to local regulations.
